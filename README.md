## Overview

A clean, responsive product preview card. It showcases a product image, title, short description, pricing (including a discounted price), and an "Add to cart" button. The layout is mobile-first and adapts between small and large screens using modern CSS (Flexbox and Grid).

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

Screenshots showing the mobile, desktop, and active/product states are included below.
